# Crack The Door-Project
Crack the Door is the application module which is used to improve the entrance ticketing system and make it easy for people to pass the gates with comfort. In addition to ticketing system, this application provides the graphical analysis which includes several comparison graphs which helps in collecting and scrutinizing every data allowing managers to target the large audience by improving the strategies categorially.

# Getting Started
- Basically initially this application module only eases up the comfort level of the visitors with the help of generation of QR code in spite of the hard paper ticket, which helps the visitors to get scan the QR code whenever needed which saves much more time and trouble. 

- The QR code will be unique and will work only for one time access. Our team has added a very useful feature i.e. of data analysis which provide graphical analysis using  several comparisons graph for more future improvement.
 
- In addition to this prototype module, our team has made a mechanism by which entrance  gates will be automated, visitors only have to make sure that their QR codes get scanned  and it helps to reduce the man power at the entrance.

-This mechanism works in such a way that whenever the QR code will get scanned, the entrance gate will open and infrared sensors at the entrance will scan and allow the number of visitors mentioned at the time of booking for a particular ticket.
